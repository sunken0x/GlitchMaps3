# Glitch Maps

**An exploration of the balance between disorder and tranquility**

## Collection Description

Since my very first piece released on the Ethereum blockchain, Discoverer, my work has always focused on mastering the glitch. After my journey into p5.js and Three.js, I felt I had finally achieved this mastery. But no one can fully ever master the glitch. No one can control the glitch. The glitch is uncontrollable.

That's why I've surrendered control to the Ethereum blockchain itself.

Glitch Maps uses the Ethereum blockchain to determine whether each piece embodies chaos or calm. The block number at the moment of minting becomes the DNA of the artwork, creating a direct representation of Ethereum's temporal progression through nine distinct chaos levels - from perfectly serene waves to fractal storms of complexity.

Each piece captures a specific moment in blockchain history, with the network's own rhythm dictating the artwork's character. As Ethereum evolves, so does the collection's emotional landscape, creating an ever-changing balance between order and disorder that reflects the living, breathing nature of the blockchain itself.

The result is a visual meditation on the duality of digital systems - the potential for both harmony and chaos that exists within every block, every transaction, every moment of the network's existence.
